It might be best to delete all the Login/Register stuff completely and simply save the form with a GUID.

We can scaffold the identity views like this (and keep only the .cshtml files)

    dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity --files Account.Login

How to add a migration:

    dotnet ef migrations add add-template-url-path

It might be worth moving `react-components` out of `wwwsrc` and into a sibling project. 

    src/
       aspnet/ <--- the aspnet source
       react/  <--- the react components

Shorter URLs to the tools would be nice. E.g. socialarts.club/as for the assertiveness scorecard

Listing all the tools on the home/landing page would be nice.

Setting the focus to each form's first input would be nice.
